During my studies, I worked on several projects, including developing a full-stack web application and implementing algorithms to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to build practical, user-focused solutions." },
    { q: "What are your strengths?", a: "I would say my biggest strengths are problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration. In team projects, I often take initiative to break down complex problems into smaller tasks, and I enjoy working with others to find efficient solutions. Iâ€™m also quick to learn new tools or frameworks when needed." },
    { q: "What are your weaknesses?", a: "At times, I can take on too many responsibilities because I want to contribute as much as possible. However, Iâ€™ve been working on improving my time management and learning how to delegate and prioritize tasks more effectively." },
    { q: "Why should we hire you?", a: "I bring both technical skills and a strong willingness to learn. My academic background gave me solid programming and analytical abilities, and my project work taught me how to collaborate effectively in teams. Iâ€™m confident I can quickly adapt to your environment and contribute value from day one." },
    { q: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?", a: "In five years, I see myself growing into a senior developer or technical lead role, where I can mentor others and take on more responsibility for designing scalable and efficient solutions. I also want to continue expanding my skills and staying up to date with emerging technologies." },
    { q: "Tell me about a challenge you faced at work.", a: "In one of my group projects, we had to refactor a large piece of legacy code that was poorly documented. It was challenging because we had to balance fixing bugs with improving the structure. I suggested that we start by writing tests for the existing code to better understand its behavior, and that approach helped us confidently refactor the system without breaking functionality." },
    { q: "How do you handle stress?", a: "I stay organized by breaking tasks into smaller steps and prioritizing the most important ones. I also find that communicating with my teammates early helps avoid last-minute pressure. When I feel overwhelmed, I take short breaks to reset, which helps me stay focused and productive." },
    { q: "Why do you want to work here?", a: "I admire your companyâ€™s mission to deliver innovative software solutions and your culture of continuous learning. Iâ€™m excited by the opportunity to work with experienced professionals, grow my skills, and contribute to meaningful projects that make a real impact." },
